MorseCode
This is a morse code reading app. It has a sender interface that sends a message the user types in as a series of camera flashes. And a receiver interface that displays to the user the decoded message the device is detecting through brightness level changes from its camera.

It uses flashes with lengths from 0.1 seconds, to 0.5 seconds in morse code format, and translates it to english on the receiver end of the app. It can work at distances from 30 ft in daylight, to about 100 ft at night. It is up to the receiving user to adjust the sensativity level to have it read accurately.
